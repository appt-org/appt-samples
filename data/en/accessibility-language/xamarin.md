# Accessibility language - Xamarin

Unfortunately, Xamarin Forms does not have support for changing the accessibility language. When you use HTML such as `<span lang="nl">Appt</span>` inside a [`Label`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/text/label), the [`lang`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_lang.asp) attribute is not used. You can create a component with a custom renderer with native Android and iOS logic. If you have done this, please contribute code.

```csharp
Not available, contribute!
