# Linting - React Native

React Native ships a built-in linter named [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/).

If possible, always update React Native to the newest version.

Avoid errors with automated testing. Follow the [Testing guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview) to get started.

```jsx
npx eslint "project/**"
```
