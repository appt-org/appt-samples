# Linting - Flutter

Flutter ships with a built-in linter named [`flutter_lints`](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-lints-package). Run `flutter analyze .` in the root of a project to return all usages of deprecated code.

If possible, always update Flutter to the newest version.

Avoid errors with automated testing. Follow the [How to test a Flutter App - Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing#0) to get started.

```dart
flutter analyze .
```
