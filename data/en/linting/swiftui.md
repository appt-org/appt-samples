# Linting - SwiftUI

For SwiftUI projects, you can use [`SwiftLint`](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to maintain and improve the quality of your code.

To prevent errors and ensure your SwiftUI code works as expected, use automated testing with the [XCTest framework](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/148/xcode-ui-testing-cheat-sheet).

```swift
swiftlint lint
```
