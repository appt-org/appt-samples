# Linting - iOS

On iOS you can use [`SwiftLint`](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to improve the quality of your code.

Avoid errors with automated testing. On iOS you can use the [XCTest framework](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/148/xcode-ui-testing-cheat-sheet).

```swift
swiftlint lint
```
