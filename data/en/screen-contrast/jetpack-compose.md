# Contrast - Jetpack Compose

In Jetpack Compose, you can use the [Accessibility Scanner app](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner) to detect contrast issues automatically. Or if your `Composables` have preview, you can run [`Compose UI checks`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#compose-ui-check) directly from Android studio, to find common accessibiltiy issues.
