# Contrast - Flutter

With Flutter, you can use the [Accessibility Scanner app](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner) and [Xcode's Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) to detect contrast issues automatically.

```dart
// No code required
```
