# Accessibility focusable - Flutter

On Flutter, the [`focusable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/focusable.html) property of [`SemanticsProperties`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html) can be used to indicate whether assistive technologies can focus on an element.

```dart
Semantics(
  focusable: false,
  child: Widget();
);
```
