# Accessibility order - React Native

React Native does not have support for changing the focus order. You can use the [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) prop to indicate that a view should be focusable. The child elements get grouped together.

More information about the lack of support for changing accessibility order can be found inside [Discussion 389](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389) of the React Native Community.
