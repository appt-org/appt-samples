# Frequent flashes - Flutter

In Flutter, flashing content often uses widgets that change on changes from a [`Stream`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Stream-class.html). For example, this could happen by using a [`StreamBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html), and thus requesting a re-draw of certain parts of the screen. Check if these objects are used to show more than three flashes per second.

If your app contains any videos, also check if these contain more than three flashes per second.
