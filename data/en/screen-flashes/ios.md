# Frequent flashes - iOS

On iOS, flashing content often uses [`DispatchQueue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue). Check if this object is used to show more than three flashes per second.

If your app contains any videos, also check if these contain more than three flashes per second.
