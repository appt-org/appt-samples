# Keyboard order - React Native

React Native has implemented all Android keyboard focus properties.

- [`nextFocusForward`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#nextfocusforward-android): specify the next element to move focus to
- [`nextFocusUp`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#nextfocusup-android): specify which element should receive focus when navigating up
- [`nextFocusDown`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#nextfocusdown-android): specify which element should receive focus when navigating down
- [`nextFocusLeft`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#nextfocusleft-android): specify which element should receive focus when navigating left
- [`nextFocusRight`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#nextfocusright-android): specify which element should receive focus when navigating right

It seems that none of the iOS keyboard focus properties have been implemented by React Native.
