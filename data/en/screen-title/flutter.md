# Screen title - Flutter

In Flutter, we recommend using an [`AppBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html) with an appropriate [`title`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar/title.html) on each screen.

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: const Text('Appt homescreen'),
  ),
  body: ...
);
```
