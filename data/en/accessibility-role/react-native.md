# Accessibility role - React Native

In React Native you can use the [`accessibilityRole`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityrole) prop to set the accessibility role of an element. Available roles include `button`, `header`, `link` and `image`, among others.

```jsx
<Pressable 
  accessibilityRole="button|header|link|image" />
```
