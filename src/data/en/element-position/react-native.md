# Element position - React Native

In React Native, you should always place your [`Headers`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/headers/) and [`Tabs`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation/) on the same position of each screen. We also recommend using [React Navigation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation) to re-use navigation components on all of your screes.
