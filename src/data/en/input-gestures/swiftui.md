# Input gestures - SwiftUI

In SwiftUI, [`gestures`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gestures) are a common way of interaction with the user interface. You can handle gestures by applying gesture modifiers directly to your views. This allows you to detect and respond to common gestures such as taps, drags, pinches, and more.

A gesture should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to provide a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.

```swift
@State private var scale: CGFloat = 1.0

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Image("appt_logo")
            .scaleEffect(scale) // Apply the scale effect
        HStack {
            Button(action: {
                // Alternative way to trigger the same action
                self.scale(factor: 0.1)
            }) {
                Text("Enlarge")
            }
            
            Button(action: {
                // Alternative way to trigger the same action
                self.scale(factor: -0.1)
            }) {
                Text("Shrink")
            }
        }
    }
    .gesture(
        MagnificationGesture()
            .onChanged { value in
                self.scale = value
            }
    )

    private func scale(factor: CGFloat) {
        self.scale += factor
    }
}
```
