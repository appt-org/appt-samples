# Input keyboard type

Setting the keyboard type for input fields helps user entering data. For example, if users need to enter a number, it helps to show a numeric keyboard. If users need to enter an e-mail address, it helps if the at-key (`@`) is shown. You should always set an appropriate keyboard type.
