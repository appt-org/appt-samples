# Accessibility hint - Flutter

With Flutter, you can set an accessibility hint by using the [`hint`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/hubt.html) property provided by the [`Semantics`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget.

```dart
Semantics(
  hint: 'Opens the Appt website'
);
```
