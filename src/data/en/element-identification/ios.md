# Element identification - iOS

In iOS, you should create custom `Views` to re-use functionality on multiple screens.

When using icons, use the search function of your `IDE` to check all instances. The icon should have the same `accessibility label` on each screen, and the functionality should also be the same.

For example, when using a cross icon for closing a screen, make sure the label is 'Close' on all screens, and check that it always closes a screen.

In Xcode you can use the shortcut  `Cmd + Shift + F` on Mac, or `Ctrl + Shift + F` on Window  to open the global `Find` function.
